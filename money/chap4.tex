\begin{definition}{Dollar-Weighted Return For a One-Year Period}
\noindent	Suppose the following information is known:
	(i) the balance in a fund at the start of the year is $A$ \\
	(ii) for $0<t_{1}<t_{2}<\cdots<t_{n}<1,$ the net deposit at time $t_{k}$ is amount $C_{k}$ (positive for a net deposit, negative for a net withdrawal), and \\
	(iii) the balance in the fund at the end of the year is $B$
	Then the net amount of interest earned by the fund during the year is $I=B-\left[A+\sum_{k=1}^{n} C_{k}\right],$ and the dollar-weighted rate of return earned by the fund for the year is
	\[
	\frac{I}{A+\sum_{k=1}^{n} C_{k}\left(1-t_{k}\right)}
	\]
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	$(Ia)_{\angles{n}}=\frac{\ddot{a}_{\bar{n}}-n v^{n}}{i}$

\begin{definition}{Time-Weighted Return For a One-Year Period}
\noinent Suppose the following information is known:\\
	(i) the balance in a fund at the start of the year is $A$\\
	(ii) for $0<t_{1}<t_{2}<\cdots<t_{n}<1,$ the net deposit at time $t_{k}$ is amount $C_{k}($ positive for a net deposit, negative for a net withdrawal)\\
	(iii) the value of the fund just before the net deposit at time $t_{k}$ is $F_{k},$ and\\
	(iv) the balance in the fund at the end of the year is $B$
	The time-weighted return rate earned by the fund for the year is
	\[
	\left[\frac{F_{1}}{A} \times \frac{F_{2}}{F_{1}+C_{1}} \times \frac{F_{3}}{F_{2}+C_{2}} \times \cdots \times \frac{F_{k}}{F_{k-1}+C_{k-1}} \times \frac{B}{F_{k}+C_{k}}\right]-1
	\]
